Manifest merger failed : uses-sdk:minSdkVersion 19 cannot be smaller than version 21 declared in library [com.github.YvesCheung:EmojiReader:1.0.1] /Users/zhangchao/.gradle/caches/transforms-2/files-2.1/e493c02df52d2b2e1625e03e420288c0/AndroidManifest.xml as the library might be using APIs not available in 19
	Suggestion: use a compatible library with a minSdk of at most 19,
		or increase this project's minSdk version to at least 21,
		or use tools:overrideLibrary="com.yy.mobile.emoji" to force usage (may lead to runtime failures)
